## Description
> [!Screenshots of key figure/table and/or direct quotes from source that substantiate the evidence statement (e.g., reports of statistical tests, or key quotes from participants), with page numbers.]

## Methods Context
> [!info] Add methods details (with associated screenshots/quotes + page numbers) that contextualize how the evidence was produced that help us to understand/evaluate/use it. Specific details vary by methodology, but at a high level we want to know **What** observable measures/data were collected **How** (with what methods, analyses, etc.) from **Who** (which participants, what dataset, what population, etc.)

### What?
> [!info] What **observable measures/data** were collected? Be as specific to the measure (not construct!!) as you can. E.g., __"mean pairwise similarity of alternative uses task responses as judged by two Upwork workers"__

### How?
> [!info] How were the measures/data collected (i.e., with what **procedures/analyses/experimental design**)? Note: this can be easy to blur with the "what", and that's ok. Focus on getting the details capture, not getting the classification just right.

### Who?
> [!info] Who was the data collected from (e.g., which participants in what context, what dataset, etc.)? As a heuristic: what is the population to which this evidence meant to generalize to?
