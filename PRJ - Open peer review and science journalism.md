## [[2025-10-27]] initial brainstorm JC and SN

No aims yet, need to brainstorm and clarify the (possible) aims :) 

We'll do this in here 

I think for now there is a bit of a high-level question of [[QUE - How might open peer review enhance science journalism]]?

But we need to nail down some ideas around possible interesting hypotheses or new design patterns to develop or build on.

JC some notes that might be helpful:
- ideas
	- collective intelligence
		- https://blog.cosmik.network/collective-intelligence-for-science
		- [[SRC - holfordScienceCommunicationCollective2023]]
- motivating cases?
- added a bunch of artifacts/patterns to the [[Open peer review and science journalism]] canvas
- qs:
	-
